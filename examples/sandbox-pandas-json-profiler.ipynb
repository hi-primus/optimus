Twodimensional, M-mode, and Doppler images were recorded from the right parasternal and left apical standard views.

In ten dogs, MV regurgitation volume was calculated by subtracting the forward stroke volume (Aortic outflow velocity time integral multiplied by the aortic cross-sectional area) from the total left ventricular (LV) stroke volume (End-systolic LV volume subtracted from the end-diastolic LV volume, both measured using Simpson's method of discs).

Cats with normal diastolic thickness of the left ventricle, but isolated basal septal hypertrophy (IBSH) ≥6 mm or SAM, were also included. The AoSA was measured from the right parasternal five chambers view, based on the published guidelines in the dog. A total of 316 cats were examined, 122 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A left parasternal SM was found in 39 cats (32%). In 10 cats the murmur was audible only after stressed auscultation. SM were associated with a narrower AoSA (P < 0.001), higher prevalence of IBSH (P < 0.01) and higher AoV (P < 0.001), compare to cats without a murmur. The IBSH increases with aging, with an increase of 0,11 mm per year. The AoSA decreases with aging (P < 0.001), with a reduction of 0.55 per year. The AoSA was narrower in cats with IBSH (P < 0.001) and IBSH was always present in cats with AoSA<120 . The AoSA did not differ between cats with or without SAM (P = 0.853). There was a non-linear correlation between AoSA and AoV. In conclusion AoSA angle and the remodeling of the interventricular septum may be correlated and can be a cause of systolic murmur in apparently healthy cats. These findings resemble the sigmoid septum found in human, which can be considered a morphologic variant of the ventricular septum, age related and associated with a systolic murmur.',\n",

Spalla, G.A. Smith, D.J. Connolly Royal Veterinary College, Potters Bar, United Kingdom Third degree atrioventricular block (AVB) is characterised by complete atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, causing independent atrial and ventricular rhythms. Persistent third degree AVB (PAVB) is most commonly described. Another form of AVB, where AV dissociation is intermittent (IAVB) is also recognised. In cats, AVB can be associated with underlying cardiac or systemic diseases. When present, clinical signs associated with these forms of AVB can include weakness, lethargy and syncope. If clinical signs and in particular syncope are present, epicardial pacemaker implantation represents an effective treatment. The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess presentation, echocardiographic data, comorbidities and outcome from cats diagnosed with AVB (PAVB or IAVB) in a single referral hospital, including those that underwent pacemaker implantation. Non parametric testing and Kaplan Meier curves with log rank testing were performed. Sixty-four cats were included over a 12-year period.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Biomarker discovery in cats with cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathies are frequent in cats and their diagnosis relies on a combination of physical examination, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography and echocardiography. Additionally, in the last decade, assays to measure circulating biomarkers of heart disease, such as cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), have become available for cats. These assays have been proven useful in the diagnosis of feline cardiomyopathies, although in certain cases they may be less reliable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect new circulating proteins that may improve the identification of cats affected by cardiomyopathy using biomarker discovery. Client-owned cats were prospectively enrolled. Evaluation comprised complete blood count and biochemical profile with T4 determination, blood pressure measurement, thoracic radiography and echocardiography. Based on diagnosis, cats were allocated to 5 groups, namely symptomatic cardiomyopathy with signs of congestive heart failure (group CM-Sx), asymptomatic cardiomyopathy (group CM-aSx), respiratory diseases (group Resp-Ds), systemic diseases without systemic hypertension (group Sys-Ds), and healthy controls (group Healthy). Plasma samples were processed untreated or following enrichment in low-abundant proteins, submitted to mass spectrometry and their protein profiles compared with statistical software. Putative biomarkers were evaluated by western immunoblotting experiments. Eighty-nine cats were included; 9 in 30 in Sys-Ds and 27 in Healthy. In CM-Sx, 7/9 cats had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 2/9 restrictive cardiomyopathy; lung edema was identified in 7, pleural effusion and aortic thromboembolism in 2. In CM-aSx, all cats had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. By mass spectrometry, several differential proteins were identified among groups. Putative biomarkers were tested by western immunoblotting and 2 of them (Protein 1 and Protein 2), were differentially detected in CM-Sx, compared to the others. In particular, Protein 1 was identified in 6/9 (66.7%) cats in CM-Sx, while plasma samples from cats in CM-aSx, Resp-Ds, Sys-Ds and Healthy had a visible band in 2/9 (22.2%), 2/14 (14.3%), 1/30 (3.3%) and 1/27 (3.7%), respectively (P < 0.001). Protein 2 was detected in the plasma of 4/9 (44.4%) cats in CM-Sx, 1/9 (11.1%) in CM-aSx and 1/30 (3.3%) in Sys-Ds, while no bands were detected in Resp-Ds and Healthy (P = 0.005). These data suggest 2 novel putative biomarkers for differentiating cats with symptomatic cardiomyopathy. Further studies with a higher number of cardiomyopathic cats and different symptomatic status are mandatory to optimize the tests and evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the candidate biomarkers.',\n",

Controls were significantly older than diabetic cats (P < 0.0001). Body condition score (BCS) was known for 718 cats, 62% of these were lean and 38% were obese. Stratified analysis using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test within strata defined in the multidimensional scaling (MDS), and logistic regression with MDS coordinates, using BCS and breed as covariates, were conducted for case:control association testing. P-values from the CMH test were adjusted for genomic inflation (λ = 1.187), and feline standard genome-wide significance was set at P < 10e-5. Max(T) permutations were used to generate corrected empirical P-values following logistic regression; significance was set at P < 0.05. A single significant SNP (chrC1:125033967; P raw [adjusted for genomic inflation] = 9.58x10e-6) was identified in the stratified analysis, and a single significant SNP (chrA2:3535683; P genome [100000 permutations] = 2.75x10e-3) was identified in logistic regression. The SNP in chromosome A2 was associated with DM in the previously reported GWAS of DM in lean DSH, but the association with the SNP in chromosome C1 in both breeds is new. These SNPs are located within and close to DPP10 and DPP9 genes, respectively, which are related to DPP4, an enzyme involved in degradation of incretins. This further analysis has revealed new potential candidate genes in both breeds, highlighting the usefulness of this alternative approach to the GWAS analysis. Both DPP9 and DPP10 have been implicated in metabolic and immune functions, suggesting that further investigation of these genes in the pathogenesis of feline DM is warranted.

In human chronic lung diseases (CLDs), the LM is altered compared with that of healthy patients. However, whether alterations are a cause or a consequence of the disease is still unclear. In dogs, the LM has been described mostly in healthy experimental beagles. However, in a previous work from our team, an impact of the living conditions and/or of the breed was suspected between healthy beagles and West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). Recent studies in mice and horses showed modifications in the LM according to the living conditions. These modifications in the LM could predispose individuals to certain CLDs. So, we aimed to assess the breed impact and the influence of living conditions, either experimental or domestic, on the LM, in healthy dogs. Results showed that the bacterial load was higher in EB dogs (P < 0.0001). The AMOVA results indicated differences between EB group compared with S and T groups (P < 0.005).

       " {'text': 'Impact of Repeated Cycles of EGF Bispecific Angiotoxin (eBAT) Administered at a Reduced Interval from Doxorubicin Chemotherapy on Tolerability and Survival of Dogs with Splenic Hemangiosarcoma Targeted toxins are promising agents designed to target receptors that are uniquely or highly expressed by cancer cells, improving tumor specificity with reduced adverse events (AEs). As their name implies, bispecific ligand-targeted toxins have dual targeting ability that confers greater binding affinity and killing ability compared to monospecific counterparts. eBAT is a bispecific epidermal growth factor (EGF) angiotoxin developed as a second generation biologic drug to specifically target tumor cells and associated vascular and inflammatory stroma for sarcoma therapy. It consists of human EGF, targeting the EGF receptor (EGFR), human amino terminal transferase (ATF) of urokinase, targeting the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and a genetically modified, de-immunized Pseudomonas exotoxin, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis. We previously reported that eBAT was safe and improved overall survival for dogs with splenic hemangiosarcoma (HSA) in the minimal residual disease setting when added to standard of care (SOC) therapy in a single cycle of three treatments. Studies with Pseudomonas exotoxin in humans have suggested that repeat cycles of administration may prolong remissions whereas the optimal timing between administration of targeted toxins and chemotherapy is unclear. The SRCBST-2 (sarcoma bispecific toxin trial-2) study described herein was undertaken to prospectively determine if multiple cycles of eBAT at the biologically active dose (50 ug/kg) given intravenously, concomitant with a reduced interval between administration of the targeted toxin and doxorubicin chemotherapy would be welltolerated and further improve outcomes of dogs with splenic HSA. Eligibility was expanded to dogs with stage-3 HSA, provided that macroscopic lesions could be surgically excised. Treatment included three planned cycles of eBAT, each administered on a Monday/Wednesday/ Friday schedule starting upon recovery from splenectomy, and continuing one week prior to the 1st, 2nd, and 5th doxorubicin events.',\n",

The endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract is often part of the diagnostic protocol for canine acute and chronic gastroenteropathy. To analyze properly the intestinal wall, it is fundamental to distend the lumen, usually inflating it with air. In human medicine, it is well known how the gas insufflation (GI) with air or carbonic dioxide during colonscopy can induce pain in the patient. More and more frequently it is used warm-to touch water, instead of air, to distend the lumen. Randomized controlled trials suggest that the introduction of water to distend the lumen of the colon decreases spasm of the musculature of the bowel and pain, and significantly increases the visualization of mucosal texture and the adenoma detection rate.',\n",

At time of presentation the dog was lethargic, and echocardiography revealed a mild pulmonic stenosis (DP = 43 mmHg) associated with severe pulmonary regurgitation (proximal width ratio assessed by color-flow Doppler mode of 100%), and secondary major right ventricular and right atrial dilation. Despite medical therapy, worsening of right heart dilation was observed two months later, and a transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation using a Melody™ valve with a pre-stenting system was decided. A contrast-enhanced cardiac-gated computed tomography 3D scan was performed one week before surgery, to accurately assess the pulmonary and coronary artery morphology, and perform measurements of the pulmonary annulus and the right ventricular outflow tract maximal diameters. Aneurysm of the pulmonary trunk with plications of the arterial wall was confirmed.',\n",

It is suggested that Japanese clinical veterinarians are evaluating their nutritional assessments by setting their IBW higher. It is found that life span can be extended by dietary restriction in dogs. From this point of view, Veterinarians should set IBM lower than their assessment results. Also, there was a large difference in the correlation coefficient between our measured body length and that measured by the clinical veterinarians. The difference was caused by the large variation in body length measurements by veterinarians.

The score was modified by the authors by creating three categories of severity: mild CSA (score between 0 and 5), moderate CSA (score between 6 and 10) and severe CSA (score between 11 and 16). The amount of fungal plaques was considered mild when countable, moderate when partially occupying the sinonasal cavity and abundant when obliterating the sinonasal cavity. A clinical scoring proposed by Schuller (2007) was modified and used to assess the patients prior to endoscopic follow-up: dogs were classified as having no (no clinical signs reported), mild (occasional sneezing, occasional reverse sneeze, serous to mucoid discharge), moderate (mucopurulent discharge, frequent sneezing, frequent reverse sneezing) or severe (severe mucopurulent discharge, stertor, persistent reverse sneezing, persistent sneezing, epistaxis, generalized malaise) clinical signs. The three scoring system were statistically analised and explicitly, we addressed the question: is there any chance to predict the persistence of fungal infection based on the score system outcome? If yes, than that scoring method was considered predictive for fungal infection persistence. A contingency table for each scoring system was computed and the null hypothesis of independence between the scoring methods and persistence of fungal infection was statistically tested by Fisher-Freeman-Halton Exact Test.',\n",
